            <h2>Why is there only a Windows download option?</h2>
            <p>Our team consists of two dedicated individuals who have poured their expertise and passion into developing this application. As a small team, we are constantly striving to prioritize and allocate our resources efficiently.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, given the limited resources and time constraints, we have made the strategic decision to concentrate our efforts on delivering the best possible experience for Windows users. By focusing on a single platform, we can streamline our development process, address issues promptly, and ensure a higher level of quality and reliability.</p>

            <h2>Why does it only Support one Website?</h2>
            <p>The genesis of our project stemmed from the idea of automating homework tasks, and example.com was chosen as the initial platform for implementation. Our team embarked on this journey with a clear vision of streamlining and simplifying homework processes for users.</p>
            <p>However, it's essential to note that our commitment to innovation and improvement extends beyond the current scope. While our application currently supports <a href="https://at4.typewriter.at/">https://at4.typewriter.at</a>, we have ambitious plans to expand its compatibility to encompass a broader array of websites in the future.</p>
